## Motivation
'''
This project contains a series models of face-recognition {sphereface, cosface, arcface, mvcos, mvarc, curricularface} that were implemented by pytorch.
All of those models are blong to the field of the deterministic model [point-estimate], so I plan to package those methods into a universal basic module for following research and project. Welcome to use
